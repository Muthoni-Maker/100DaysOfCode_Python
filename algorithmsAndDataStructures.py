"""Data Structures and algorithms in python
Defination:Structures that are used to hold related data together.
Build-in Data structures-lists
                       -tuples
                        -dictionaries
                        -sets

User-Defined structures 
                       -stack
                       -  Queue
                       -Tree
                       -Graph
                       -HashMap
                       -Linked List

Algorithms are stepwise way of solving a problem
They provide the pseudocode for problems
Not language specific
How to write an algorithm
               -Find out what is theexact problem
               -Determine where you need to start
               -Determine where you need to stop
               -Formulate the intermediate steps
               -Review your steps

Elements of a good algorithm
               -Steps should be finite,clear and understandable
               -Clear and precise descriptions
               -Each step must have a definite output that depends only on the inputs in that steps or preceding steps
               -The algorithm should be flexible
               -The steps should make use of general programming fundamentals


Algorithm classes-Divide and conqure algorithms   
                 -Greedy algorithms
                 -Dynamic programming
